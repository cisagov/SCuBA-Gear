# CISA M365 Security Configuration Baseline for Sharepoint Online and OneDrive

SharePoint Online is a web-based collaboration and document management
platform. It is primarily used to collaborate on documents and communicate information in project teams. OneDrive is a cloud-based file storage system primarily used to store a user's personal files but it can also be used to share documents with others. This security baseline provides policies to help secure both of these services.
